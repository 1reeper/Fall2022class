# Winter2020class

In this repo,
you can open issues to ask questions
and get help with problems that you run into throughout the course.
Remember to first search through existing issues
to see if there already exists an answer that solves your problem.
Feel free to help your colleagues if you know the answer to a question,
this is a great opportunitiy to get familiar with using GitHub issues!
